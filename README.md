> "Hell is other [insects]."

NOEXIIT, or *NOvel Ethological X-Insect Interaction Task*, is a behavioural rig for presenting a mechanical stimulus whose approach is adjustable to an insect tethered on a floating ball. We originally developed NOEXIIT to present different kinds of pinned insects to a tethered walking beetle.
