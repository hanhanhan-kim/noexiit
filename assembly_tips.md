  - Stepper motor; see phidget
  - Timing belt; SDP/SI: A 6B 3-040037 alternative; most lengths of at least __ should work so long as it's XL pitch, just adjust accordingly
  - Pinions; will determine resulting gear ratio
- Talk about creating sufficient tension by pulling on the slotted fixtures before anchoring to breadboard
- VERY IMPORTANT: In order to reduce vibrations, make sure the belt isn't over-tensioned. Too much tension pulls on the rotary tube, which causes it to be not directly straight and perpendicular to the breadboard. The tube's rotation then becomes a little diagonaled, which transmits the vibrations. Similarly, it's important to adjust all the parts that are secured onto the breadboard. A helpful tip is to run the air to the ball and make sure that the ball exhibits 'ambient' rotations. If the ball is quickly moving in a single direction, adjust the positioning and securing of the parts to the breadboard, until ambient rotations of the ball are observed.
