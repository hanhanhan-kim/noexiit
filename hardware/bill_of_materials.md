## Commercial Parts: Stimulus Presentation

In addition to the parts in the below table, I recommend:

- 1/4"-20 x 3/8" and x 1" screws, and 1/4"-20 washers
- 8-32 x 1/4", x 3/8", and x 1/2" screws, and 8-32 washers
- 6-32 x 1/4", x 3/8", and x 1/2" screws 
- M2.5 x 12 mm ([McMaster-Carr 91292A016](https://www.mcmaster.com/91292A016/)) screws
- 6-32 x 3/8" ([McMaster-Carr 92220A142](92220A142)) and x 1/2" ([McMaster-Carr 92220A183](https://www.mcmaster.com/92220A183/)) specialty low-profile socket-head screws

For most cases in this build, the 3/8" length and 1/2" length screws of a given threading are interchangeable, but best practice it to use the shortest length screws whenever possible. Remember to apply all screws evenly.
